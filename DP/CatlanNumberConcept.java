// ! Catalan numbers are defined as a mathematical sequence that consists of positive integers, which can be used to find the number of 
// !possibilities of various combinations. 
// *The nth term in the sequence denoted Cn, is found in the following formula: (2n)/((n+1)! n!)
// *The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ are : 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862,.....
// !C0=1 , C1=1 , C2=C0*C1 + C1*C0=2 , C3=C0*C2 + C1*C1 + C2*C0=5.............  
// Catalan numbers occur in many interesting counting problems like the following.

// Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses that are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
// Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
// Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
// Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
