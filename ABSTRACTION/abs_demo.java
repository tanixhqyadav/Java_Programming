// package ABSTRACTION;
// !Abstraction is achieved in Java through abstract classes and interfaces.
// !An abstract class can have both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).
// !An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods (Java 8 introduced default methods, which are concrete).

public class abs_demo extends abstract_ion {
    // ! so here the actual method is intialized
    void printStatus(){
        System.out.println("hi i am tanishqyadav ");
